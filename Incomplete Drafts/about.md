# About Incomplete Drafts
Since I originally made this repository to host files for job applications, I thought I should add some old and incomplete drafts here to show my thinking processes while writing.

The drafts in this document are unedited. They might contain information that are either outdated or false. In fact, some of these might have even had newer versions written in my private library which might not be suitable for public viewing.
