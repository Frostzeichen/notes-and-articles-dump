note: This is an article on which I present a new format - an italicized abstract on the first paragraph to better guide me on how I should continue writing this article in the future. This also presents the first time I have ever used metadata to store more information about an article. Talk about *historical*.

*Following developments on neural networks, I believe that these are what we can call **pure** networks; they have less biases towards neural connections based on structure. However, they **do** have biases. Their biases and our biases, as humans with human brains, offer an insight into what biases truly are, and what a **pure neural network** should look like.

Intro: Human biases are largely affected by brain structures.

P2: Define biases as used in this article. (Biases cause neural networks to prefer a certain conclusion/output over others. There are learned biases like trauma, addictions, and preferences, and there are natural biases like stress responses and normal illusions.)

P3: The brain is a neural network and a neural network is a brain of sorts. Hence, even AIs have biases based on their physical structures (their binary forms, algorithmic tendencies, etc). Figuring out these biases can show us how we and AI can make logical mistakes based on the biases of our structures.

P4: What are these biases in AI?

P5: In humans, there are more biases that we are currently aware of. Presents body of literature showing biases but no need to elaborate further.

P6: An example in which AI can make logical mistakes due to their physical bias (their inability to comprehend something due to the nature of their structure).

P7: Reiterate my point. The same can happen to us, humans. But because we are unaware, we don't know these biases unless we seek them out. And for AI, we can develop them in ways that they can understand their biases or work around them in a manner that they would understand. (aka degrees of existence) (impromptu conclusion for now) (will expand perhaps on a later article)
