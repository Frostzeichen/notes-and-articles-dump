# Terenz's Notes and Articles Dump
This repository hosts notes and articles I have written for public viewing. Most of these were specifically written for my private digital library of literature.

## Instructions
For the best viewing experience, I suggest using either [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) plugin for rendering graphs and diagrams.

## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to add a more decent structure for the files and folders I am hosting in this repository.

I also plan to add a guide for installing Obsidian and using Mermaid.js on Visual Studio Code.
